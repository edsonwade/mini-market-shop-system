1. Set Environment Variable

You can resolve this issue by setting an environment variable that tells Node.js to use the older OpenSSL configuration:

On Linux/macOS:

bash

export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider


On Windows (Command Prompt):

cmd

set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

On Windows (PowerShell):

powershell

$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"

This variable allows Node.js to use legacy OpenSSL providers that are compatible with older cryptographic operations.
2. Add Environment Variable to .env File

For convenience, especially if you want to make this change persistent across different environments, you can add the environment variable to your .env file in your project root:

    Create a .env file in your project’s root directory if it doesn’t already exist.

    Add the following line to the .env file:

    plaintext

NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

This ensures that the environment variable is set every time you start your development server.
3. Upgrade Dependencies

Ensure all your dependencies are up-to-date, as newer versions of packages may have resolved compatibility issues with Node.js v17 and later:

    Update npm:

    bash

npm install -g npm@latest

Update dependencies:

bash

npm outdated
npm update


4. Consider Downgrading Node.js

If the issue persists, consider downgrading Node.js to a stable version known to be compatible with your project’s dependencies. Node.js v16 LTS (Long-Term Support) is a good choice:

    Use Node Version Manager (nvm):

    If you have nvm (Node Version Manager) installed, you can easily switch Node.js versions:

    bash

nvm install 16
nvm use 16

If you don’t have nvm, you can install it from nvm's GitHub repository.

Reinstall dependencies after downgrading:

bash

rm -rf node_modules
npm install
